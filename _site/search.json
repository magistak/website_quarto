I’ll focus on searching for bisulfite datasets.\n\n\nQuery NCBI SRA advanced search\n\n\nWith the SRA Advanced Search Builder:\n\n\n\nFor field strategy, click Show index list, choose “bisulfite seq”\n\n\nclick search, I filter for species and DNA on the next page\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/advanced\n\n\n\nFilter runs\n\n\nI filtered for source: DNA and Organism: Homo Sapiens\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra\n\n\n\nYou can also search by modifying Search details. Mine right now:\n\n\"bisulfite seq\"[Strategy] AND \"Homo sapiens\"[orgn] AND \"biomol dna\"[Properties]\n\nYou get the same results with this URL:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=%22bisulfite%20seq%22%5BStrategy%5D%20AND%20%22Homo%20sapiens%22%5Borgn%5D%20AND%20%22biomol%20dna%22%5BProperties%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch\n\nI got 54368 results as of 2025.07.23.\n\n\nSend to SRA Run Selector\n\n\nClick Send to -&gt; Choose Destination: Run Selector\n\n\nThis brings you to:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?query_key=4&WebEnv=MCID_687f8c820ad1cd6f51d404fa&o=acc_s%3Aa\n\n\n\nDownload Metadata\n\n\nClick Download Metadata. You get a csv.\n\n\n\n\ncsv downloaded from run selector\n\n\n\nThis contains metadata like Age for all runs. Not every dataset publishes age though.\n\n\nProcess metadata\n\n\nMy goal in this step was to find datasets with Age metadata from certain tissues. Unfortunately the metadata is not unified, it takes some work. I processed in R.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)df_read &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sra_human_bisulfite.csv\")df &lt;-df_read %&gt;%   filter(!is.na(AGE)) %&gt;%   group_by(BioProject) %&gt;%   summarise(    n=n(),    unique_tissues = list(unique(tissue)),    unique_celltype= list(unique(cell_type)),    unique_tissue_cell_type = list(unique(`tissue/cell_type`)),    unique_tissue_type = list(unique(tissue_type)),    unique_sample_type= list(unique(sample_type)),    unique_isolate= list(unique(isolate)),    unique_age = list(unique(AGE)),    unique_source_name = list(unique(source_name))  ) %&gt;%   arrange(desc(n))\n\nIt aggregates them by dataset (BioProject) and sort them by sample number. I then investigated further the most interesting ones.\n\n\n\n\nsra csv aggragated by BioProject\n\n\n\n\n\nRead and Comment on Medium"
